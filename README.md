Checks status of a cpanel license
### dmenu-launch ###
Runs commands using dmenu.
### dvol ###
dmenu volume controller, edited from dotfiles.it

Actually doesn't even use feh, but it makes image viewing nicer than before.

Either updates all git repo's in your drive, or only the specified directory.

Moves the mouse to the center of focused window, good for tiling wm's.

Runs commands as user with no permissions, and a home in /tmp/

Uses menu to show an interactive list of screen sessions.

Either connects to a screen running a command, or creates a new one.

I use this for per-user configuration in lightdm.

Makes assigning PCI devices to vfio-pci a bit easier.
